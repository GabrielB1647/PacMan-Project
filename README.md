# PacMan-Project

In this exercise, the user is able to create multiple PacMen at the click of a button and will be able to enjoy watching them move across the screen at their own individual pace. 

Road Map of Future Improvements: I plan to make some adjustments to the size and speed of the Pacman, maybe even change the color.  Furthermore, I might use this concept to create and add varying shapes and colors.  


## How to Run: 
- Launch index.html
- click start game button
- click add pacman button
- enjoy!
